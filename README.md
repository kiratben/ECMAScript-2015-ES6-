# ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
---
## Introduction

ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009.

## JavaScript vs. ECMAScript
JavaScript was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich while at Netscape, reportedly in only 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, a name chosen by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, but was renamed four months later to LiveScript. At that time, Sun Microsystems owned the trademark for JavaScript. Netscape acquired a trademark license and renamed LiveScript to JavaScript in December 1995. It was somewhat of a marketing maneuver since Java was really popular at the time. The languages are not related at all.

Some time between 1996 and 1997, Netscape took JavaScript to the Ecma standards organization to carve out and maintain a specification for the language to enable other browser vendors to implement based on the work they had done. The Ecma Technical Committee 39 (better known as TC39) was created to continue to evolve the language, eventually releasing ECMA-262 Ed.1 in June 1997. ECMAScript is name of the official standard with JavaScript being the most well-known implementation of the standard. ActionScript (Macromedia) and JScript (Microsoft) are examples of other implementations.

Versions of JavaScript are defined by the specification that bears the official name of the language. For example, the first standard version of JavaScript was ECMAScript 1. It’s common practice now to abbreviate the standards specification to simply ES_X_, although the X will be changing in 2016 as TC39 shifts to a yearly release cadence. More on that towards the end of this post. All features in ECMAScript go through a formal proposal process. A proposal for a new feature, usually originating from the developer community, begins with a sketch or “strawman proposal” that provides an initial description of the proposed feature. If TC39 agrees that the feature is valuable, it will be promoted to official “Proposal” status. The deadline for ES6 proposals was way back in May 2011.

The next status is “In Implementation” where the feature is actually implemented in ideally 2 JavaScript engines. These implementations, as well as developer community feedback, help shape the proposal during its evolution. Finally if the proposal continues to prove to be valuable, TC39 will accept and it will be added to the next version of ECMAScript. It is now a “Standard.”
